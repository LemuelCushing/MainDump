* 463,400 ha (139,000 by SMART) - including plasma smallholders 
* Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) from plantations is processed in 489 palm oil mills that supply Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and Palm Kernel (PK) to eight refineries

---

"We have already mapped our supply chain to the mill. This means that we know the locations and relevant details of all 489 palm oil mills that supply CPO and PK to our eight downstream locations. Now we want to extend our knowledge and sustainability outreach efforts to the plantations, smallholders, and dealers supplying FFB to these mills"

### Main issues:

  - Smallholder related:
    - productivity & quality
    - Problematic relations
    - Land issues
  - Certification (RSPO)
    - Ensure compliance
    - Implement best-practices across the board
    - Transparency & enviormental
  - Overall yield increase & cost-reduction

## Smallholders:

## Smallholders:

  ### Nucleus & Plasma Scheme
    - Reduced yield
    - Late transfer of the plasma plantation because the Inti does not meet the physical standard set by the   
   GoI
   - Long delays in receiving allotted land and loan financing.
   - Low productivity of the harvest especially due to the lack of skills
   - Uncompetitive selling price of the FFB sold to the Inti because of low quality

"Smallholders are an important but economically vulnerable production group in palm oil. Their vulnerability is partly due to the characteristics of the commodity: Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) or palm oil fruit should be milled within 24 hours after harvest to maintain its quality. As palm oil smallholders often do not have the means to sell and transport their FFB quickly, the quality of their FFB is easily reduced (Colchester and Jiwan 2006, Hanu and Sadjli 2013). Other factors contributing to smallholders’ economic vulnerability are uncertainty about market access, price fluctuations in the market, lack of knowledge about maintaining palm oil plantations which reduces their productivity, and their dependency on agents to sell their outputs to mills (Papenfus 2000, Marti 2008)."

## Smallholders:

  - Technical limitation - Mobile coverage


## Certification:

  - RSPO (Roundtable On Sustainable Palm Oil)
  - ISCC (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification)

## Certification & Smallholders:


"inclusion of smallholders in palm oil certification has proven to be difficult " (Opijnen, Brinkmann, and Meekers 2013)

---

## Productivity:

"land selection, planting materials, technical management, harvesting and environmental. If all categories in oil palm plantations can be managed and integrated with each other will be obtained by the production of fresh fruit bunches and plenty fit the desired production. 

Active management of and integration between diverse production categories (Land selection, planting materials, technical management, harvest and environmental monitoring, to name but a few), has direct effects on productivity" (See [Salmiyati et al. 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212670814001213))

## Our solutions:
  
  - Easily RSPO-compliant management system 
  - Formalized standard procedures will ensure that issues such as land disputes are avoided
  - Transparent, third-party tracking of 
  - Smallholders' entire work process can be conducted through AgriTask, making sure they both comply with all certificate requirements and best-practices
  - Integrated management of plantation company services to the farmers (management, technical support, loans, fertilizer and pesticide lending), with direct response to reported situation and automatic calculation vis a vis initial loans, if any.
  - Off-line capabilities
