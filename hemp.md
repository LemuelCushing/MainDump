
# Hemp in the USA:

On June 2018, the US Senate has approved the 5-yearly Farm Bill, to which which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has amended the language of his [Hemp Farming Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp_Farming_Act_of_2018), removes hemp (defined as cannabis with less than 0.3% THC) from Schedule I controlled substances and making it an ordinary agricultural commodity. 

The act that McConnell would remove restrictions on banking access, water rights and other roadblocks that hemp farmers and processors currently face. The U.S. Department of Agriculture would receive oversight plans from states, and then state departments of agriculture would regulate local production. The bill would also make USDA research funding available to farmers, and hemp plants would be eligible for crop insurance.

It is expected to pass the Senate, still Republican after the 2018 midterms, and is unlikely to be opposed by House Democrats, and might go directly to 

A resolution to designate June 4-10 as Hemp History Week has passed without objections.

Currently, the US industry uses a large amount of hemp, but due to current regulations, it is mostly imported, "the value of hemp imported into the United States for use in the production of other retail products is estimated at approximately ₪278m ($76m) annually". The bill also cites projections that the annual market value of hemp retail sales in the U.S. is worth more than ₪2.5b ($688m).

“The Hemp Farming Act of 2018 is landmark legislation that will be remembered as the key element which finally allowed the hemp industry to flourish in the U.S" said Eric Steenstra, president of [Vote Hemp](https://www.votehemp.com/)

On May 2018, a key Senate committee set aside half a million dollars to support the restoration of a federal hemp seed genebank, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration sent an internal directive instructing agents not to go after legal hemp products.

### Hawaii:

The state has issued its first three licenses to hemp growers in Hawaii as part of its Industrial Hemp Pilot Program.
In June, the Hawaii Department of Agriculture issued industrial hemp licenses to Gail Baber and Thomas Pace of Hawaii island, and Raymond Maki of Kauai, each of whom have 10 acres to grow the hemp seed variety, Yuma, imported from China, state officials said today. (July 6, 2018)

Industrial hemp growers will be required to submit extensive reports on planting, harvesting and movement of their industrial hemp crop. They must also track production costs, including pest management, water usage, security measures, labor, marketing and other factors, state officials said. The plants also must be tested for THC and pesticides, and inspections are mandatory.

Since the program began in April, the state has received 10 applications. The agriculture department will process applications and issue licenses on a quarterly basis, officials said. The 11-page application is available [online](http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/hemp/).
