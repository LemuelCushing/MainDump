Palm oil:

Indonesia:
- Smallholders:
  Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). The RSPO, formally established in 2004, is a Northern-based international multi-stakeholder initiative in sustainable palm oil cultivation with members and participants from different backgrounds and with different interests, including palm oil processors and traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks/investors, representatives of oil palm producers, and social and environmental NGOs. The RSPO is generally regarded as a promising certification scheme; it has a considerable impact on production processes and a market share of certified palm oil of about 15% (Schouten and Glasbergen 2012, Schouten, Leroy, and Glasbergen 2012).
- However, inclusion of smallholders in palm oil certification has proven to be difficult (Opijnen, Brinkmann, and Meekers 2013), despite efforts made by the RSPO to accommodate smallholders in the RSPO system. The General Assembly established a Smallholder Task Force (STF) in 2005, focusing on the relevance and applicability of the RSPO principles and criteria for smallholders. In 2012, the RSPO’s Smallholders’ Fund Initiative (SFI) was launched to support the smallholders’ certification process and to increase smallholders’ awareness on the advantages of certification (Pesqueira and Glasbergen 2013). Smallholders are an important but economically vulnerable production group in palm oil. Their vulnerability is partly due to the characteristics of the commodity: Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) or palm oil fruit should be milled within 24 hours after harvest to maintain its quality. As palm oil smallholders often do not have the means to sell and transport their FFB quickly, the quality of their FFB is easily reduced (Colchester and Jiwan 2006, Hanu and Sadjli 2013). Other factors contributing to smallholders’ economic vulnerability are uncertainty about market access, price fluctuations in the market, lack of knowledge about maintaining palm oil plantations which reduces their productivity, and their dependency on agents to sell their outputs to mills (Papenfus 2000, Marti 2008).

## Sustainability
 
* Improved yield as means towards greater sustainability
  * Gather large-scale high resolution soil information -> avoid nutrient deficiencies
  * Reduce post-harvest loss by improving *traceability*

### Traceability

An estimated two million smallholders in Indonesia own over 40 percent of palm oil estates in the country. We believe that reaching out to this section of the industry is vital for improving their welfare as well as the social and environmental practices across the industry.

One of the ways that GAR is doing this is through the Traceability to Plantation project. GAR is currently piloting this at a number of its own mills. We aim to achieve TTP for GAR mills by the end of 2017 and TTP for our independent supplier mills by end 2020.

In mapping our supply chain to the point of origin we are reaching out and getting to know our individual suppliers such as FFB brokers and more importantly individual farmers. We talked to some of them about traceability and sustainability during a recent training session at our Ujung Tanjung mill.

## Solutions: 

* Self-Mapping capabilities

[Smartphone user penetration in Indonesia 2014-2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/257046/smartphone-user-penetration-in-indonesia/) - rapidly rising smartphone use among local populace can enable a an easier channel of communication between Smart Tbk (Sinas Mas) and smallholders.
This can ease areas of oil palm–community conflict by
* Assist certification bodies (e.g. the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil-RSPO, and the Indonesian and Malaysian versions, ISPO and MSPO)
* Mutual accountability (thus improving trust between communities and palm-oil companies - ["perceived lack of consultation, compensation and broken promises by companies"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143622816306087) )
* Clearing land boundary disputes
* Easy differentiation between legal and illegal operations

### Certification:

* Only 3.8% (of 4,415,800 hectares) of the smallholders’ oil palm plantations have been certified (2015 estimated value) [Hidayat et al 2015](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/39604347/Sustainability_Certification_and_Palm_Oi20151102-23171-16qcloi.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1540814196&Signature=1Th6%2B9RlYKd3JkDx%2Byf1N9MW%2B%2BY%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DSustainability_Certification_and_Palm_Oi.pdf)

## Offline capabilities:

* When palm-oil production is juxtaposed with 2G / 3G / 4G coverage (Using figures for Telkomsel, by far the largest carrier in the area), the need for offline capabilites becomes evident.

land selection, planting materials, technical management, harvesting and environmental. If all categories in oil palm plantations can be managed and integrated with each other will be obtained by the production of fresh fruit bunches and plenty fit the desired production. 

Active management of and integration between diverse production categories (Land selection, planting materials, technical management, harvest and environmental monitoring, to name but a few), has direct effects on productivity (See [Salmiyati et al. 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212670814001213))

## Point for presentation:

## Concrete screen ideas:

- Stand -> Yield Estimation/Fruit count
- Prenursery to Planting monitoring
  - "Whenever rainfall is less than 10 mm per day, irrigation is required, and the system must be capable of uniformly applying 6.5 mm water per day"
  - Irrigation control alerts based on live weather data - possible to integrate with irrigation system 
- Soil samples 
- Potassium application alert for sandy or peaty soils
  - AgriTask can help producers to measure right time to and regularity of fertilizers application.
- Palm weevil
- "Hoter" monitoring and alert for ideal risk-reduction of palm weevil attraction
- Large scale monitoring of pests, diseases, yield and costs

- Reduce the costs of Certification (As per Roundtable On Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) recommendation) 

- Find ideal path for use of 'lift tools' (< FIND NAME) 

Question:
  - Collection logistics? Do you mean Suzano PoC?
